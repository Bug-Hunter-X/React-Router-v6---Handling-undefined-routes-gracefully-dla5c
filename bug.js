In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  This results in the application rendering nothing or causing unexpected behavior.  This often happens when there's a typo in the `to` prop of the `<Link>` component or a mismatch between the route path defined using `Routes` and `Route` components, and the URL the user is attempting to access.
